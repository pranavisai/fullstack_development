    <h1>This is the basics of HTML</h1>
    <p>We have headings from h1 to h6. </p>
    <p>And if we just use tab and write the next line it still comes as in the same line.</p>
    <p>We will need to create separate tags and write the content for it to show in different lines.</p>

<p><strong>strong tag is used for bold. <em>emphasis tag (em) is used for italics</em></strong></p>
<p>HTML has two types of lists. Ordered and Unordered.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second time</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Third Item</li>
  <li>Fourth Item</li>
</ul>

<p>Example of Nested List:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Example of ordered list item</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This item is nested inside ordered list</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
<p>Div tag which stands for division is used to tag together groups of elements into generic containers</p
<div class="group1">
  <p>This sentence is under a div tag. Used mainly in CSS when we learn to add style to the HTML page.</p>
</div
<span></span>
<p>Span tag is similar to <span>div tag but it is inline</span> div tag but it is inline instead of an entire container.</p>
<h3>Attributes</h3>
<p>image is a self closing tag. As the tag is completely self contained.</p>
<p>src is for source and alt is for the alternate image or text to show in case the src is not available.</p>
<img src="wwf.png" alt="">
<p>If the image file is not within the same folder we need to give the entire path of the
image.We can even use a link to the image from the internet to put that as an image.</p>
<p>anchor tag </p>
<p>If the page is in the same folder we do not need to give the full path just the name. But in a different folder we need to
give the full path.</p>
<p>Even if we give stuff like a proper web page with http to pass on the websites that are outside the folder, the browser autocorrects it into
and takes to the secure site.</p>
<a href="newpage.html">Click me!</a>
<p>We can use the plain p tags with no text to create some space between two lines.</p>
